# LQ_collider_project
Codes and data for the LQ collider research project, which corresponds to the paper: "----" by myself (João Pedro Pino Gonçalves) and collaborators (Werner Porod, António Morais, António Onofre and Roman Pasechnik). arXiv:0000.00000 

**LQ_UFO_py2** Contains the UFO files, as well as an example parameter card (restrict_default.dat) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. Python2 version

**LQ_UFO_py3** Contains the UFO files, as well as an example parameter card (restrict_default.dat) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. Python3 version

**SARAH** Contains the SARAH implementation of the model. Can be used for some analytical calculations as well as to generate files for other opensource HEP codes

**MadGraph_codes** Auxiliary python code for contructing MadGraph parameter cards as well as a python interface with MadGraph to generate events. Also includes analysis codes for extraction of kinematic/angular observables from .root files generated by Delphes. 

Note: For the card generation, data from https://github.com/Mrazi09/Leptoquark-project---Data is used. In particular the data from the Data_v3 folder.

**Data_MadGraph** Some numerical data used for the simulations and plots

**Plots** Folder with various plots, as well as the associated python script (as well as a jupyter notebook) to draw them
