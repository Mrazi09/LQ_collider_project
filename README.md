# LQ_collider_project
Codes and data for the LQ collider research project, which corresponds to the paper: "----" by myself (João Pedro Pino Gonçalves) and collaborators (Werner Porod, António Morais, António Onofre and Roman Pasechnik). arXiv:0000.00000 

**LQ_UFO_py2** Contains the ```UFO``` files, as well as an example parameter card (```restrict_default.dat```) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. ```python2``` version

**LQ_UFO_py3** Contains the ```UFO``` files, as well as an example parameter card (```restrict_default.dat```) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. ```python3``` version

**SARAH** Contains the ```SARAH``` implementation of the model. Can be used for some analytical calculations as well as to generate files for other opensource HEP codes

**MadGraph_codes** Auxiliary ```python``` code for contructing MadGraph parameter cards as well as a ```python``` interface with MadGraph to generate events for the LQ model. I have also included a similar interface but written in ```bash```, which I used for the backgrounds. Also includes analysis codes for extraction of kinematic/angular observables from ```.root``` files generated by ```Delphes```. 

Note: For the card generation, data from https://github.com/Mrazi09/Leptoquark-project---Data is used. In particular the data from the Data_v3 folder.

**Data_MadGraph** Some numerical data used for the simulations and plots

**Plots** Folder with various plots, as well as the associated ```jupyter``` notebook to draw them

**Benchmark_cards** Folder with the benchmark cards for different masses of the lightest leptoquark.

**Gaussian_fits** Guassian fits to the log probability histograms to every observable studied in this work. Also includes a ```jupyter``` notebook that performs the computations named ```Pvalue_root.ipynb``` (inside the Code sub-folder). Requires .csv with the histograms, which is inside this repository in the Data_MadGraph/CSV_Data folder 

**Gaussian_fits** Guassian fits to the log probability histograms for observables that offer a separation greater than $5\sigma$
