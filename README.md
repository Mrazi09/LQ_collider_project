# LQ_collider_project

Codes and data for the LQ collider research project, which corresponds to the paper: "Exploring mixed lepton-quark interactions in non-resonant leptoquark production at the LHC" by myself (João Pedro Pino Gonçalves) and collaborators (Werner Porod, António Morais, António Onofre and Roman Pasechnik). arXiv:23XX.XXXXX 

**LQ_UFO_py2** Contains the ```UFO``` files, as well as an example parameter card (```restrict_default.dat```) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. ```python2``` version

**LQ_UFO_py3** Contains the ```UFO``` files, as well as an example parameter card (```restrict_default.dat```) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. ```python3``` version

**SARAH** Contains the ```SARAH``` implementation of the model. Can be used for some analytical calculations as well as to generate files for other opensource HEP codes

**MadGraph_codes** Auxiliary ```python``` code for contructing MadGraph parameter cards as well as a ```python``` interface with MadGraph to generate events for the LQ model. Aso includes analysis code for extraction of kinematic/angular observables from ```.root``` files generated by ```Delphes```. 

**Data_MadGraph** Some numerical data used for the simulations and plots

**Plots** Folder with various plots, as well as the associated ```jupyter``` notebook to draw them

**Benchmark_cards** Folder with the benchmark cards for different masses of the lightest leptoquark.

**Gaussian_fits** ```jupyter``` notebook for guassian fits to the log probability histograms, named ```Pvalue_root.ipynb```. Also contain plots for the 1.5 TeV benchmark, for the $p_T(\mu^-)$ and $M(\mu^+,\mu^-)$ distributions. Can be easily adapated for the other observables, one just needs to change the name of variable ```Obs``` to the desired one. Requires the data that is inside the Data_MadGraph folder of this repo.

**Simulation notes** The events were generated in MG5_aMC_v3_4_1 (```python3```). It was also tested in MG5_aMC_v2_8_1 (```python3```), MG5_aMC_v2_7_2 (```python3```), MG5_aMC_v2_7_3 (```python3```) and MG5_aMC_v2_7_0 (```python2```). All of them gave identical results.


To download, click on ```<> Code``` on top of the page and select ```Download ZIP```. One can also use git to clone the repo to your local machine as ```git clone https://github.com/Mrazi09/LQ_collider_project.git``` in the terminal. The later option requires ```git``` to be installed in our system. Alternatively, to download a single folder, one can use ```DownGit```.
