# LQ_collider_project
Codes and data for the LQ collider research project, which corresponds to the paper: "----" by myself (João Pedro Pino Gonçalves) and collaborators (Werner Porod, António Morais, António Onofre and Roman Pasechnik). arXiv:0000.00000 

**LQ_UFO_py2** Contains the ```UFO``` files, as well as an example parameter card (```restrict_default.dat```) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. ```python2``` version

**LQ_UFO_py3** Contains the ```UFO``` files, as well as an example parameter card (```restrict_default.dat```) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. ```python3``` version

**SARAH** Contains the ```SARAH``` implementation of the model. Can be used for some analytical calculations as well as to generate files for other opensource HEP codes

**MadGraph_codes** Auxiliary ```python``` code for contructing MadGraph parameter cards as well as a ```python``` interface with MadGraph to generate events for the LQ model. Aso includes analysis code for extraction of kinematic/angular observables from ```.root``` files generated by ```Delphes```. 

**Data_MadGraph** Some numerical data used for the simulations and plots

**Plots** Folder with various plots, as well as the associated ```jupyter``` notebook to draw them

**Benchmark_cards** Folder with the benchmark cards for different masses of the lightest leptoquark.

**Gaussian_fits** ```jupyter``` notebook for guassian fits to the log probability histograms, named ```Pvalue_root.ipynb```. Also contain plots for the 1.5 TeV benchmark, for the $p_T(\mu^-)$ and $M(\mu^+,\mu^-)$ distributions. Can be easily adapated for the other observables, one just needs to change the name of variable ```Obs``` to the desired one. Requires the data that is inside the Data_MadGraph folder of this repo
